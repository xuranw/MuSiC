# MUlti-sample SIgle Cell deconvolution (MuSiC)

`MuSiC` is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline that leverages single-cell sequencing data to estimate cell type proportions of RNA-seq data from bulk tissue samples.

## Examples
We reproduce here the analysis detailed in ...
  * Total gene expression data were obtained from GEO dataset GSE50244, which contains read counts data on gobal transcriptomic analysis of bulk human pancreatic islets to study glucose metabolism in healthy and hyper-glycemic conditions (Fadista et al. 2014).
  * Single cell RNA-seq data were generated by E-MTAB dataset E-MTAB-5060, which contains read counts data on single cell mRNA-seq of human pancreatic islets from 10 donors, 6 healthy donors and 4 Type 2 diabetes donors (S). We used single cell data from 6 healthy donors as reference in deconvolution.
